            <p>This project deals with describing an interface that is commonly used by the general public. We were required
              to observe users interact with some sort interface, interview their experience with it, record their observations,
              and illustrate a storyboard for one of the personas we observed. For my interface, I chose to do the Brown University
              mail room check in station, in which users use their ID to pickup their packages.

            <p>This is part 2 of the assignment in which we were required to observe users using the interface and describe what we saw. We were also required
              to list the questions we asked and the responses we recieved.

            <p>This is part 3 of the assignment in which we were required to create two different personas of individuals using four-quadrant empathy maps.
              Here, we have two personas (Bill and Fiona) where each of their characters decsribes, generally, two different kinds of people I observed using
              this interface.

            <p>Finally, this is part 4 of the assignment in which we were required to create a storyboard of a persona's journey from start to end while using
              the interface. Here, I chose Fiona as the persona to illustrate. Although the art isn't perfect, it depicts the process of their experience with 
              the interface.
